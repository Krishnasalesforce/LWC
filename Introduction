LWC Introduction

We can learn all the Salesforce features using Trailheads which is provided by salesforce.


For Learning Apex, Lightning, Visualforce pages we can create a new Developer edition or New TrailHead Play ground.


But If we want to learn Lightning web components(LWC), we are not able to code on salesforce. So that salesforce introduced new concepts for LWC.



Pre-requisites:
As usual, we need a new Developer edition or New TrailHead Play ground.
Install Salesforce CLI.
Install Visual Studio Code and extensions.
